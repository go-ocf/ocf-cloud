# gRPC Gateway

gRPC Gateway exposes the client's gRPC API to manage the user's devices.

## Docker Image

```bash
docker pull plgd/grpc-gateway:latest
```

## Docker Run

### How to make certificates

Before you run docker image of plgd/grpc-gateway, you make sure certificates exists on `.tmp/certs` folder.
If not exists, you can create certificates from plgd/bundle image by following step only once.

```bash
# Create local folder for certificates and run plgd/bundle image to execute shell.
mkdir -p $(pwd).tmp/certs
docker run -it \
  --network=host \
  -v $(pwd)/.tmp/certs:/certs \
  -e CLOUD_SID=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001 \
  --entrypoint /bin/bash \
  plgd/bundle:latest

# Copy & paste below commands on the bash shell of plgd/bundle container.
certificate-generator --cmd.generateRootCA --outCert=/certs/root_ca.crt --outKey=/certs/root_ca.key --cert.subject.cn=RootCA
certificate-generator --cmd.generateCertificate --outCert=/certs/http.crt --outKey=/certs/http.key --cert.subject.cn=localhost --cert.san.domain=localhost --signerCert=/certs/root_ca.crt --signerKey=/certs/root_ca.key

# Exit shell.
exit
```

```bash
# See common certificates for plgd cloud services.
ls .tmp/certs
http.crt http.key root_ca.crt root_ca.key
```

### How to get configuration file

A configuration template is available on [grpc-gateway/config.yaml](https://github.com/plgd-dev/cloud/blob/v2/grpc-gateway/config.yaml).
You can also see `config.yaml` configuration file on the `grpc-gateway` folder by downloading `git clone https://github.com/plgd-dev/cloud.git`.

```bash
# Copy & paste configuration template from the link and save the file named `grpc-gateway.yaml` on the local folder.
vi grpc-gateway.yaml

# Or download configuration template.
curl https://github.com/plgd-dev/cloud/blob/v2/grpc-gateway/config.yaml --output grpc-gateway.yaml
```

### Edit configuration file

You can edit configuration file such as server port, certificates, OAuth provider and so on.
Read more detail about how to configure OAuth Provider [here](https://github.com/plgd-dev/cloud/blob/v2/docs/guide/developing/authorization.md#how-to-configure-auth0).

See an example of address, tls, event bus/store and OAuth config on the followings.

```yaml

        certFile: "/data/certs/http.crt"
...
```

### Run docker image

You can run plgd/grpc-gateway image using certificates and configuration file on the folder you made certificates.

```bash
docker run -d --network=host \
  --name=grpc-gateway \
  -v $(pwd)/.tmp/certs:/data/certs \
  -v $(pwd)/grpc-gateway.yaml:/data/grpc-gateway.yaml \
  plgd/grpc-gateway:latest --config=/data/grpc-gateway.yaml
```
