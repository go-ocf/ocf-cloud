# HTTP Gateway

HTTP Gateway exposes the client's [REST API](https://petstore.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plgd-dev/cloud/v2/http-gateway/swagger.yaml) to manage the user's devices, as well as the Web UI known as [plgd Dashboard](...).

## Docker Image

```bash
docker pull plgd/http-gateway:latest
```

## Docker Run

### How to make certificates

Before you run docker image of plgd/http-gateway, you make sure certificates exists on `.tmp/certs` folder.
If not exists, you can create certificates from plgd/bundle image by following step only once.

```bash
# Create local folder for certificates and run plgd/bundle image to execute shell.
mkdir -p $(pwd).tmp/certs
docker run -it \
  --network=host \
  -v $(pwd)/.tmp/certs:/certs \
  -e CLOUD_SID=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001 \
  --entrypoint /bin/bash \
  plgd/bundle:latest

# Copy & paste below commands on the bash shell of plgd/bundle container.
certificate-generator --cmd.generateRootCA --outCert=/certs/root_ca.crt --outKey=/certs/root_ca.key --cert.subject.cn=RootCA
certificate-generator --cmd.generateCertificate --outCert=/certs/http.crt --outKey=/certs/http.key --cert.subject.cn=localhost --cert.san.domain=localhost --signerCert=/certs/root_ca.crt --signerKey=/certs/root_ca.key

# Exit shell.
exit
```

```bash
# See common certificates for plgd cloud services.
ls .tmp/certs
http.crt  http.key  root_ca.crt  root_ca.key
```

### How to get configuration file

A configuration template is available on [http-gateway/config.yaml](https://github.com/plgd-dev/cloud/blob/v2/http-gateway/config.yaml).
You can also see `config.yaml` configuration file on the `http-gateway` folder by downloading `git clone https://github.com/plgd-dev/cloud.git`.

```bash
# Copy & paste configuration template from the link and save the file named `http-gateway.yaml` on the local folder.
vi http-gateway.yaml

# Or download configuration template.
curl https://github.com/plgd-dev/cloud/blob/v2/http-gateway/config.yaml --output http-gateway.yaml
```

### Edit configuration file

You can edit configuration file such as server port, certificates, OAuth provider and so on.
Read more detail about how to configure OAuth Provider [here](https://github.com/plgd-dev/cloud/blob/v2/docs/guide/developing/authorization.md#how-to-configure-auth0).

See an example of address, tls, event bus and service clients config on the followings.

```yaml
...
apis:
  http:
    address: "0.0.0.0:9086"
    tls:
      caPool: "/data/certs/root_ca.crt"
      keyFile: "/data/certs/http.key"
      certFile: "/data/certs/http.crt"
      clientCertificateRequired: false
    authorization:
      authority: "https://auth.example.com/authorize"
      audience: "https://api.example.com"
      http:
        tls:
          caPool: "/data/certs/root_ca.crt"
          keyFile: "/data/certs/http.key"
          certFile: "/data/certs/http.crt"
...
clients:
  grpcGateway:
    grpc:
      address: "localhost:9083"
      tls:
        caPool: "/data/certs/root_ca.crt"
        keyFile: "/data/certs/http.key"
        certFile: "/data/certs/http.crt"
...
ui:
  enabled: true
  directory: "/usr/local/var/www"
  oauthClient:
    domain: "auth.example.com"
    clientID: "412dsFf53Sj6$"
    audience: "https://api.example.com"
    scope: "openid,offline_access"
    httpGatewayAddress: "https://www.example.com"
```

### Run docker image

You can run plgd/http-gateway image using certificates and configuration file on the folder you made certificates.

```bash
docker run -d --network=host \
  --name=http-gateway \
  -v $(pwd)/.tmp/certs:/data/certs \
  -v $(pwd)/http-gateway.yaml:/data/http-gateway.yaml \
  plgd/http-gateway:latest --config=/data/http-gateway.yaml
```
