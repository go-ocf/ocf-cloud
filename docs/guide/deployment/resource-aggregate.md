# Resource Aggregate
Resource Aggregate translates commands to events, stores them to database and publishes them to messaging system.

## Docker Image

```bash
docker pull plgd/resource-aggregate:latest
```

## Docker Run
### How to make certificates
Before you run docker image of plgd/resource-aggregate, you make sure certificates exists on `.tmp/certs` folder.
If not exists, you can create certificates from plgd/bundle image by following step only once.
```bash
# Create local folder for certificates and run plgd/bundle image to execute shell.
mkdir -p $(pwd).tmp/certs
docker run -it \
	--network=host \
	-v $(pwd)/.tmp/certs:/certs \
	-e CLOUD_SID=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001 \
	--entrypoint /bin/bash \
	plgd/bundle:latest

# Copy & paste below commands on the bash shell of plgd/bundle container.
certificate-generator --cmd.generateRootCA --outCert=/certs/root_ca.crt --outKey=/certs/root_ca.key --cert.subject.cn=RootCA
certificate-generator --cmd.generateCertificate --outCert=/certs/http.crt --outKey=/certs/http.key --cert.subject.cn=localhost --cert.san.domain=localhost --signerCert=/certs/root_ca.crt --signerKey=/certs/root_ca.key

# Exit shell.
exit
```
```bash
# See common certificates for plgd cloud services.
ls .tmp/certs
http.crt	http.key	root_ca.crt	root_ca.key
```

### How to get configuration file
A configuration template is available on [resource-aggregate/config.yaml](https://github.com/plgd-dev/cloud/blob/v2/resource-aggregate/config.yaml).
You can also see `config.yaml` configuration file on the `resource-aggregate` folder by downloading `git clone https://github.com/plgd-dev/cloud.git`.
```bash
# Copy & paste configuration template from the link and save the file named `resource-aggregate.yaml` on the local folder.
vi resource-aggregate.yaml

# Or download configuration template.
curl https://github.com/plgd-dev/cloud/blob/v2/resource-aggregate/config.yaml --output resource-aggregate.yaml
```

### Edit configuration file 
You can edit configuration file such as server port, certificates, OAuth provider and so on.
Read more detail about how to configure OAuth Provider [here](https://github.com/plgd-dev/cloud/blob/v2/docs/guide/developing/authorization.md#how-to-configure-auth0). 

See an example of address, tls, event bus/store and OAuth config on the followings.
```yaml
...
apis:
  grpc:
    address: "0.0.0.0:9083"
    tls:
      caPool: "/data/certs/root_ca.crt"
      keyFile: "/data/certs/http.key"
      certFile: "/data/certs/http.crt"
    authorization:
      authority: "https://auth.example.com/authorize"
      audience: "https://api.example.com"

          keyFile: "/data/certs/http.key"
          certFile: "/data/certs/http.crt"
...
clients:
  eventBus:
    nats:
      url: "nats://localhost:4222"

        keyFile: "/data/certs/http.key"
        certFile: "/data/certs/http.crt"
...
  eventStore:
    mongoDB:
      uri: "mongodb://localhost:27017"
      database: "eventStore"

        certFile: "/data/certs/http.crt"
...
  authorizationServer:
    grpc:
      address: "localhost:9081"
      tls:
        caPool: "/data/certs/root_ca.crt"
        keyFile: "/data/certs/http.key"
        certFile: "/data/certs/http.crt"
    oauth:
      clientID: "412dsFf53Sj6$"
      clientSecret: "235Jgdf65jsd4Shls"
      scopes: "openid"
      tokenURL: "https://auth.example.com/oauth/token"
      audience: "https://api.example.com"
...
```

### Run docker image 
You can run plgd/resource-aggregate image using certificates and configuration file on the folder you made certificates.
```bash
docker run -d --network=host \
	--name=resource-aggregate \
	-v $(pwd)/.tmp/certs:/data/certs \
	-v $(pwd)/resource-aggregate.yaml:/data/resource-aggregate.yaml \
	plgd/resource-aggregate:latest --config=/data/resource-aggregate.yaml
```

::: tip Audience 
You might have one client, but multiple APIs in the OAuth system. What you want to prevent is to be able to contact all the APIs of your system with one token. This audience allows you to request the token for a specific API. If you configure it to myplgdc2c.api in the Auth0, you have to set it here if you want to also validate it.
:::

> Note that the string type related to time (i.e. timeout, idleConnTimeout, expirationTime) is decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as "300ms", "1.5h" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "ns", "us", "ms", "s", "m", "h".
