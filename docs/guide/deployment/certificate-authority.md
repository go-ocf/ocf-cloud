# Certificate Authority

This service is used to sign identity certificates for devices and [plgd-dev/sdk](https://github.com/plgd-dev/sdk) client.

> Initialization of the SDK requires an Identity Certificate issued by this service after successful user authorization. The SDK is then able to discover and configure the ownership as described [here](https://openconnectivity.org/specs/OCF_Security_Specification_v2.2.3.pdf#page=37). During this process, a CSR (Certificate Signing Request) is sent to the Certificate Authority which returns device's Identity Certificate.
>
> e.g. plgd mobile application uses SDK for device ownership configuration. Available on both [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.plgd.client&hl=sk&gl=US), [Apple Store](https://apps.apple.com/sk/app/plgd/id1536315811).

## Docker Image

```bash
docker pull plgd/certificate-authority:latest
```

## Docker Run

### How to make certificates

Before you run docker image of plgd/certificate-authority, you make sure certificates exists on `.tmp/certs` folder.
If not exists, you can create certificates from plgd/bundle image by following step only once.

```bash
# Create local folder for certificates and run plgd/bundle image to execute shell.
mkdir -p $(pwd).tmp/certs
docker run -it \
  --network=host \
  -v $(pwd)/.tmp/certs:/certs \
  -e CLOUD_SID=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001 \
  --entrypoint /bin/bash \
  plgd/bundle:latest

# Copy & paste below commands on the bash shell of plgd/bundle container.
certificate-generator --cmd.generateRootCA --outCert=/certs/root_ca.crt --outKey=/certs/root_ca.key --cert.subject.cn=RootCA
certificate-generator --cmd.generateCertificate --outCert=/certs/http.crt --outKey=/certs/http.key --cert.subject.cn=localhost --cert.san.domain=localhost --signerCert=/certs/root_ca.crt --signerKey=/certs/root_ca.key

# Exit shell.
exit
```

```bash
# See common certificates for plgd cloud services.
ls .tmp/certs
http.crt  http.key  root_ca.crt  root_ca.key
```

### How to get configuration file

A configuration template is available on [certificate-authority/config.yaml](https://github.com/plgd-dev/cloud/blob/v2/certificate-authority/config.yaml).
You can also see `config.yaml` configuration file on the `certificate-authority` folder by downloading `git clone https://github.com/plgd-dev/cloud.git`.

```bash
# Copy & paste configuration template from the link and save the file named `certificate-authority.yaml` on the local folder.
vi certificate-authority.yaml

# Or download configuration template.
curl https://github.com/plgd-dev/cloud/blob/v2/certificate-authority/config.yaml --output certificate-authority.yaml
```

### Edit configuration file

You can edit configuration file including server port, certificates, OAuth provider and so on.
Read more detail about how to configure OAuth Provider [here](https://github.com/plgd-dev/cloud/blob/v2/docs/guide/developing/authorization.md#how-to-configure-auth0).

See an example of address, tls on the followings.

```yaml
...
apis:
  grpc:
    address: "0.0.0.0:9087"
    tls:
      caPool: "/data/certs/root_ca.crt"
      keyFile: "/data/certs/http.key"
      certFile: "/data/certs/http.crt"
    authorization:
      authority: "https://auth.example.com/authorize"
      audience: "https://api.example.com"
      http:
        tls:
          caPool: "/data/certs/root_ca.crt"
          keyFile: "/data/certs/http.key"
          certFile: "/data/certs/http.crt"
...
signer:
  keyFile: "/data/certs/root_ca.key"
  certFile: "/data/certs/root_ca.crt"
...
```

### Run docker image

You can run plgd/certificate-authority image using certificates and configuration file on the folder you made certificates.

```bash
docker run -d --network=host \
  --name=certificate-authority \
  -v $(pwd)/.tmp/certs:/data/certs \
  -v $(pwd)/certificate-authority.yaml:/data/certificate-authority.yaml \
  plgd/certificate-authority:latest --config=/data/certificate-authority.yaml
```
