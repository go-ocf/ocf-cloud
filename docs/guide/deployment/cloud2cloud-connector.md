```

## Docker Run

### How to make certificates

Before you run the docker image of plgd/cloud2cloud-gateway, you make sure that certificates exist in `.tmp/certs` folder.
If they do not exist, you can create certificates from the plgd/bundle image by executing the following step once:

```bash
# Create a local folder for certificates and run the plgd/bundle image to execute a shell.
mkdir -p $(pwd).tmp/certs
docker run -it \
  --network=host \
  -v $(pwd)/.tmp/certs:/certs \
  -e CLOUD_SID=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001 \
  --entrypoint /bin/bash \
  plgd/bundle:latest

# Copy & paste the commands below to the bash shell of the plgd/bundle container.
certificate-generator --cmd.generateRootCA --outCert=/certs/root_ca.crt --outKey=/certs/root_ca.key --cert.subject.cn=RootCA
certificate-generator --cmd.generateCertificate --outCert=/certs/http.crt --outKey=/certs/http.key --cert.subject.cn=localhost --cert.san.domain=localhost --signerCert=/certs/root_ca.crt --signerKey=/certs/root_ca.key

# Exit the shell.
exit
```

```bash
# See common certificates for plgd cloud services.
ls .tmp/certs
http.crt  http.key  root_ca.crt  root_ca.key
```

### How to get configuration file

A configuration template is available in [cloud2cloud-connector/config.yaml](https://github.com/plgd-dev/cloud/blob/v2/cloud2cloud-connector/config.yaml).
You can also see the `config.yaml` configuration file in the `cloud2cloud-connector` folder by downloading `git clone https://github.com/plgd-dev/cloud.git`.

```bash
# Copy & paste the configuration template from the link and save the file as `cloud2cloud-connector.yaml` to a local folder.
vi cloud2cloud-connector.yaml

# Or download the configuration template with curl.
curl https://github.com/plgd-dev/cloud/blob/v2/cloud2cloud-connector/config.yaml --output cloud2cloud-connector.yaml
```

### Edit configuration file

You can edit values in the configuration file such as server port, certificates, OAuth provider and so on.
Read more details about how to configure the OAuth Provider [here](https://github.com/plgd-dev/cloud/blob/v2/docs/guide/developing/authorization.md#how-to-configure-auth0).

The following example shows configuration of address, clients and the rest of configuration.

```yaml

### Run docker image

You can run the plgd/cloud2cloud-connector image using certificates and configuration file in the folder you made certificates in.

```bash
docker run -d --network=host \
  --name=cloud2cloud-connector \
  -v $(pwd)/.tmp/certs:/data/certs \
  -v $(pwd)/cloud2cloud-connector.yaml:/data/cloud2cloud-connector.yaml \
  plgd/cloud2cloud-connector:latest --config=/data/cloud2cloud-connector.yaml
```

::: tip Audience
You might have one client, but multiple APIs in the OAuth system. What you want to prevent is to be able to contact all the APIs of your system with one token. This audience allows you to request the token for a specific API. If you configure it to myplgdc2c.api in the Auth0, you have to set it here if you want to also validate it.
